# SpringBootHelloWorld
This is the first spring boot task. I understood how you can set up spring boot
and hence set up your entire project beacuse spring boot helps you with a lot of
the configuration part of the project. I also managed to understand how some of the
annotations work and what they are used for. In addition, I understood how to 
create mock HTTP requests send towards the server in order to test the system without
having to run the entire program every time. I also understood how from the normal
jUnit tests you can apply the spring Boot testing module as well in order to be able
to perform mockMVC testing.

#Things that need a bit more clarity
Personally I couldn't understand the clear use of the actuator module of Spring Boot
and how it can be applied in some real life projects. An example of its use could
definitely help with that regard.
